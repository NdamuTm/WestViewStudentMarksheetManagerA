# Student Marksheet System

## Question 2: 50 Marks

### Scenario
WestView College is a private institute of higher education located in South Africa. Theyâ€™ve been having a tough time managing student records, especially when it comes to tracking assessment marks. Theyâ€™ve asked for your help to develop a system that will manage their student marksheets. 

### Project Requirements
You are tasked with creating a Java application that manages student marksheets using ArrayLists and classes. Your program should be able to:

1. **Add Student:** Add a new student with their marks for multiple subjects.
2. **Display Marksheet:** Display the marks of all students along with their total marks and average.
3. **Search Student:** Search for a student by name and display their marks.
4. **Calculate Grade:** Calculate grades based on marks (e.g., A, B, C, D, F) for each student.
5. **Sort Students:** Sort students in ascending order based on their total marks.
6. **Update Marks:** Allow updating marks for any student.
7. **Delete Student:** Delete a student record.

### Program Functionality
- **Add a Student:** Enter the student's name and their marks for multiple subjects. The program will handle this with grace and a touch of humor.
- **Display Marksheet:** Shows a detailed report of all students, including their total marks, average, and grade.
- **Search and Update:** Search for a student and update their marks. If you're feeling especially forgiving, you can delete them too!
- **Sort Students:** Because order is everything, sort students by their total marks or their names.
- **Exception Handling:** The program will gracefully handle any unexpected input, ensuring no one gets left behind.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NdamuTm/WestViewStudentMarksheetManagerA.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd WestViewStudentMarksheetManager
    ```
3. **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    javac Main.java Student.java
    ```
4. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

### Usage
1. **Run the program.**
2. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**
    - Choose to add a new student, display the marksheet, search for a student, or sort students.
    - If updating or deleting, follow the additional prompts.
    - Enter the required data and see your student records come to life!
3. **Enjoy the functionality of a well-oiled student management machine!**

### Tools Used
- **Replit:** For quick testing and rapid prototyping.
- **VS Code:** For coding with a side of caffeine.
- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate:** For those advanced features that make life easier.
- **NetBeans:** Because sometimes, we just need good old reliable project management.

### Credits
This project was brought to you with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of student management magic. Special thanks to WestView College for trusting me with their student records! Also, a shoutout to every student who ever asked for an extensionâ€”this one's for you!
